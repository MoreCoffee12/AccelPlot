# Accel Plot
This is an Android application that reads data from an Arduino and HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module, plots it, and saves it to the device. The hardware build is described in more detail in an [Instructables project](https://www.instructables.com/id/Realtime-MPU-6050A0-Data-Logging-With-Arduino-and-/). The image below shows a screen shot of the application collecting data.

The project also include a Jupyter iPython Notebook that opens the data files and plots them.
